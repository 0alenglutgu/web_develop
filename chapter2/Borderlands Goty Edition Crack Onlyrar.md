The voice cast for the film underwent some changes from the original series. Corey Burton, who had voiced Dale in previous iterations, was initially reported to reprise his role, but in December 2020, a surprise announcement revealed that Andy Samberg would take over the voice of the adventurous chipmunk. John Mulaney was also announced as the voice of Chip, Dale's cautious brother, and Seth Rogen was confirmed to have a cameo appearance in the film.[6] The teaser trailer, which debuted on February 15, 2022, introduced more voice actors for the supporting characters.[11] However, fans of the original series were delighted when a new trailer in April 2022 confirmed that Burton would still voice Dale for some lines, and Tress MacNeille would also return as the voice of Chip for some scenes.[30]

The film is a live-action/CGI hybrid that follows the adventures of Chip and Dale, two chipmunk brothers who run a detective agency. They are hired by a young girl named Zoe to find her missing father, a scientist who was working on a mysterious device. Along the way, they encounter various obstacles and enemies, such as the evil Professor Nimnul, a rival detective named Monterey Jack, and a horde of robotic rats.
  
The film is directed by Akiva Schaffer, who is also a member of the comedy group The Lonely Island with Samberg. Schaffer said that he wanted to make a film that was faithful to the spirit of the original series, but also updated it for modern audiences. He said that he was inspired by films like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Ghostbusters, and that he wanted to create a fun and exciting adventure comedy with a lot of heart.
  
The film is scheduled to be released on July 28, 2023, by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the first theatrical film based on the Chip 'n Dale characters, and the second film in the Disney Afternoon Cinematic Universe, following DuckTales: The Movie in 2021. The film has received positive reviews from critics and fans, who praised the humor, action, animation, and voice acting.
