No samples or pre-rendered waveforms are used, which means you have full control over the sound design and can create any kind of drum sound you want. You can also morph between different sounds and patterns, alter them randomly, or use the Patternarium feature to access thousands of computer generated presets and patches.

Another plug-in from Sonic Charge that you might want to check out is Synplant[^3^], an innovative software synthesizer with a genetic approach to sound creation. Synplant lets you explore a world of organic sounds by planting seeds that grow into synth patches. Instead of creating patches the conventional way by turning dials and knobs, you can use your ears and intuition to shape the sounds in a natural and fun way.
 
Synplant has a simple and playful interface that hides a powerful and versatile synthesizer engine. You can tweak the basic parameters of each sound seed, such as envelope, filter, and effects, or you can dive deeper into the genetic code and modify the DNA of each sound. You can also mutate, breed, and cross-pollinate different sounds to create new variations and hybrids.
 
Synplant comes with a large collection of presets and patches that cover a wide range of styles and genres. You can also download additional content packages[^3^] such as Synplant Cellspace Vol. 1, which contains 64 new patches created by various artists and sound designers. Synplant is compatible with Windows and Mac, and supports VST and Audio Unit formats.
 
Synplant is currently available for $99 (+VAT) from the Sonic Charge website[^3^]. You can also download a 3 week trial version to try it out for yourself. If you buy Synplant today, you will only pay the price difference if you want to upgrade to the more expensive Synplant 2, which is coming in 2023.
 
If you are looking for a creative and inspiring way to make unique and organic sounds, Synplant is a plug-in that you should definitely try. It will open up new possibilities for your sound design and music production.
