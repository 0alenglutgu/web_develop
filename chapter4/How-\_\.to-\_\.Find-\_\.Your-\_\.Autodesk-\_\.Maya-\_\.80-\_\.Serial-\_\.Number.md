## Method 1: Find Your Serial Number and Product Key in Autodesk Account
 
The easiest way to find your serial number and product key is to log in to your Autodesk account at [https://manage.autodesk.com](https://manage.autodesk.com). This is where you can manage all your products and services from Autodesk, including your subscriptions, downloads, updates, and billing information.
 
Once you are logged in, follow these steps:
 
1. Under All Products and Services, find Autodesk Maya 8.0 and click View Details.
2. If you see License Details on the product details page, select it to display your serial number and product key. If you don't see License Details on your product details page, you don't have a serial number[^1^].

Note: Your serial number is the same for all versions of a standalone or multi-user subscription product[^2^].
 
## Method 2: Find Your Serial Number and Product Key in the Product
 
If you have already installed Autodesk Maya 8.0 on your device, you can also find your serial number and product key in the product itself. Here's how:

1. Start Autodesk Maya 8.0.
2. Click Help > About, or About Autodesk Maya.
3. In the About window, click Product Information or Product License Information.
4. You should see your serial number and product key displayed in the window.

## Method 3: Request a License Report from Support
 
If none of the above methods work for you, you can also request a license report from Autodesk support. This is a document that contains information about your license type, serial number, product key, activation code, expiration date, and other details.
 
To request a license report, go to [https://www.autodesk.com/support](https://www.autodesk.com/support) and follow these steps:

1. Click the Post-purchase support box.
2. Select User and License Management.
3. Select Manage Licenses.
4. Select License reports and fill in the mandatory fields to submit your request.

Note: Only primary admin, secondary admin can request for license report. Otherwise, the email address domain of the requester should match the company name[^1^].
 
## Conclusion
 
Finding your Autodesk Maya 8.0 serial number and product key is not difficult if you know where to look. You can use any of the methods we have described above to retrieve them from your Autodesk account, your product, or support.
